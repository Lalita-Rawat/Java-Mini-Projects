# Java Mini Projects

This repository contains **20 small Java projects** created while learning Java programming.  
All projects are developed using **IntelliJ IDEA** and demonstrate **Core Java concepts** like OOP, inheritance, abstraction, method overloading, and more.  

Each project has its own folder with source code and instructions to run in IntelliJ IDEA.
