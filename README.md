# Java Mini Projects

This repository contains **20 small Java projects** created while learning Java programming.  
All projects are developed using **IntelliJ IDEA** and demonstrate core Java concepts such as **OOP, inheritance, abstraction, method overloading, polymorphism, file handling, and GUI (Swing/AWT)**.

Each project has its own folder with source code and instructions to run in IntelliJ IDEA.
